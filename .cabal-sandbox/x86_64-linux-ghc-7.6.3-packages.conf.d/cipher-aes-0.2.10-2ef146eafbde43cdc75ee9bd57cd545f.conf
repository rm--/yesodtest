synopsis: Fast AES cipher implementation with advanced mode of operations
description: Fast AES cipher implementation with advanced mode of operations.
             .
             The modes of operations available are ECB (Electronic code book),
             CBC (Cipher block chaining), CTR (Counter), XTS (XEX with ciphertext stealing),
             GCM (Galois Counter Mode).
             .
             The AES implementation uses AES-NI when available (on x86 and x86-64 architecture),
             but fallback gracefully to a software C implementation.
             .
             The software implementation uses S-Boxes, which might suffer for cache timing issues.
             However do notes that most other known software implementations, including very popular
             one (openssl, gnutls) also uses similar implementation. If it matters for your
             case, you should make sure you have AES-NI available, or you'll need to use a different
             implementation.
